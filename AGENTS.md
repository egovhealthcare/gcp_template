# Project Guidelines

## Overview

This repository contains GCP infrastructure-as-code for [CARE](README.md), built with OpenTofu and Helm on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Architecture

Modules must be applied in the following order:

| Order | Module | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `pre-infra/` | Project bootstrap: API enablement, optional DNS zone |
| 2 | `KMS/` | Key ring, encryption keys, and application secrets (`django_secret_key`, `django_admin_password`, `metabase_encryption_secret_key` via `random_password`) |
| 3 | `infra/` | VPC, GKE, Cloud SQL, GCS buckets, Cloud Armor, GitHub WIF |
| 4 | `deploy/` | Kubernetes namespace, secrets, Helm releases |

The `infra/` module references KMS keys created by `KMS/`. The `deploy/` module reads remote state from `infra` (prefix `infra`) and `KMS` (prefix `keys`) via `terraform_remote_state` data sources in `deploy/init.tf`.

## Build and Deploy

Each module directory contains a Makefile with the following targets:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make init` | Initialize OpenTofu with GCS backend |
| `make pull-tfvars` | Pull tfvars from Secret Manager |
| `make plan` | Generate an execution plan |
| `make deploy` | Apply infrastructure changes |
| `make destroy` | Tear down resources |
| `make lint` | Format files recursively |
| `make push-tfvars` | Push local tfvars to Secret Manager |

### Required Environment Variables

Set the following before running any target:

- `PROJECT_ID` (or `TF_VAR_project_id`)
- `ENV_NAME` (or `TF_VAR_environment` / `TF_VAR_env_name`)
- `BACKEND_BUCKET`

### State Backend Prefixes

| Module | Prefix |
|--------|--------|
| `pre-infra/` | `pre-infra` |
| `KMS/` | `keys` |
| `infra/` | `infra` |
| `deploy/` | `deploy-backend` |

> The `deploy/` module runs `tofu plan` with `-lock=false`. All other modules use normal locking.

## Configuration

All configuration is driven by tfvars files. See [environments/sample.tfvars](environments/sample.tfvars) for the complete variable shape.

- Real tfvars are stored in Secret Manager under the name `tofu-tfvars-<env>`.
- The `make pull-tfvars` target retrieves them to `../environments/<env>.tfvars`.
- Real tfvars must never be committed to the repository.

## Conventions

### Naming

Resource names follow the pattern `{org}-{app}-{environment}` with resource-specific suffixes. Any derived name can be overridden using the `coalesce(var.override, derived_default)` pattern.

### Shared Variables

The root `variables.tf` is symlinked into each module directory. Do not create separate copies. All variables, including deploy-specific ones (`helm_config`, `additional_secrets`, `additional_config_map_data`, `additional_plugs`, `enable_legacy_ingress`), are defined in this single file.

### Naming Overrides

The following optional variables override auto-derived resource names. All default to `null`:

`cluster_name`, `namespace_name`, `vpc_network_name`, `database_subnet_name`, `gke_subnet_name`, `pods_range_name`, `services_range_name`, `gateway_ip_name`, `legacy_ingress_ip_name`, `legacy_fe_ip_name`, `flow_logs_bucket`, `cloudsql_private_ip_name`, `nat_ip_address_name`, `wif_sa_name`

### Feature Flags

Boolean variables control optional infrastructure with `count` or `for_each`:

| Flag | Controls |
|------|----------|
| `enable_dicom` | DICOM stack (bucket, database, dcm4chee chart) |
| `enable_cloud_armor` | Cloud Armor security policies |
| `enable_github_wif` | GitHub Actions Workload Identity Federation |
| `enable_legacy_ingress` | Legacy GCE Ingress resources |
| `enable_dns_zone` | Cloud DNS managed zone |

### Provider Versions

All modules pin: `google`/`google-beta` `~> 6.33`, `random ~> 3.7`, OpenTofu `~> 1.11`.

The `deploy/` module additionally requires: `kubernetes ~> 2.0`, `helm ~> 2.0`, `tls ~> 4.0`, `local ~> 2.0`.

### Helm Value Injection

Helm values are defined as locals in `deploy/helm-values.tf` and passed directly to `helm_release` resources in `deploy/helm.tf` via `yamlencode()`. Chart-specific values are merged with `common_helm_values` (defined in `deploy/locals.tf`) at release time. File-based value generation under `deploy/generated_values/` is currently disabled.

Local charts: `gateway`, `redis`, `metabase`, `care_be`, `care_fe`, `dcm4chee`.

Additionally, `cert-manager` (`v1.19.4` from `https://charts.jetstack.io`) is installed as a hard dependency for TLS and Gateway API integration. The Gateway Helm release depends on cert-manager being ready.

### External TLS Certificates

Optional variables allow injecting a wildcard TLS certificate instead of relying entirely on cert-manager:

- `external_tls_cert` / `external_tls_key` — PEM-encoded cert and key (both required or both null)
- `external_tls_base_domains` — list of base domains covered by the wildcard (required when cert is provided)

When provided, cert-manager only issues certificates for domains NOT covered by the wildcard.

### Helm Config Variable Shape

`var.helm_config` is an object containing non-DICOM image settings plus optional replica, resource, and rollout overrides. Resource overrides must be complete Kubernetes resource blocks; use `limits.cpu = null` to explicitly remove a CPU limit.

```hcl
helm_config = {
  deployment_strategy = "Recreate"
  care_backend  = { repository = "...", tag = "...", api_replica_count = 1 }
  care_frontend = { repository = "...", tag = "...", replica_count = 1 }
  metabase      = { repository = "...", tag = "...", replica_count = 1 }
  redis         = { repository = "...", tag = "...", replica_count = 1 }
}
```

### Checksum-Based Pod Restarts

Pod annotations include checksums computed from secret and config data (`sha256(jsonencode(...))`). When secret or config map values change, the checksum changes, triggering a rolling restart without manual intervention.

### Helm Charts

Charts are located under `helm_charts/`. Refer to [.github/instructions/helm.instructions.md](.github/instructions/helm.instructions.md) for detailed conventions. All charts share an identical `_helpers.tpl` pattern for naming, labels, and service account helpers.

## Infrastructure Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **GKE** | Regional cluster with Gateway API, Workload Identity (`terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google` ~> 36.3) |
| **Cloud SQL** | Two PostgreSQL 17 Enterprise instances (primary + Metabase), private IP, optional read replicas |
| **GCS Buckets** | Three CMEK-encrypted buckets (patient, facility, DICOM) with HMAC access |
| **Cloud Armor** | Regional security policy with OWASP rules and geo-blocking |
| **Jumphost** | Debian 13 VM with OpenTofu pre-installed (`infra/jumphost.tf`) |
| **GitHub WIF** | Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions CI/CD |

## Secrets Flow

```
infra/ (DB passwords, HMAC keys) ──┐
                                    ├──→ deploy/locals.tf (secret maps) ──→ kubernetes_secret ──→ Pods
KMS/ (Django secrets, Metabase key) ┘
```

Three secret maps in `deploy/locals.tf`:
- `secret_data` — CARE backend (DB creds, GCS keys, Redis URL, Django secrets, JWKS) + `var.additional_secrets`
- `metabase_secret_data` — Metabase DB connection + encryption key
- `dicom_secret_data` — DICOM DB + LDAP + GCS (conditional on `enable_dicom`)

The deploy module also generates `random_password.ldap_admin_password` for the dcm4chee LDAP stack.

## Provider Authentication (deploy module)

The `deploy/` module authenticates to GKE using:
- `gke_dns_endpoint` (DNS-based control plane endpoint) from `infra` remote state
- Access token from `data.google_client_config`

Valid GCP credentials with cluster access are required.

## Pitfalls

- Module apply order is strict. Applying out of order will fail.
- Never commit real tfvars files. Store them in Secret Manager.
- Ensure correct value types in tfvars: numbers as numbers, booleans as booleans.
- The `variables.tf` files in module directories are symlinks. Edit only the root copy.
- To add new secrets, update `local.secret_data` in `deploy/locals.tf`. The `kubernetes_secret` in `deploy/secrets.tf` reads from that map automatically.
- `additional_config_map_data` injects entries into the backend ConfigMap. `additional_secrets` injects entries into the Kubernetes Secret.
- `additional_plugs` is a top-level string tfvar (JSON-encoded array) that is overwritten by the deploy pipeline from each env's `build/care/care.env` `ADDITIONAL_PLUGS` line on every run. It is injected into the backend ConfigMap as `ADDITIONAL_PLUGS`. Edit it in the deploy-states repo, not in the tfvars secret. Do not also set `ADDITIONAL_PLUGS` inside `additional_config_map_data` — that would override the top-level value. Do not nest it under `additional_config_map_data` either; `hcledit` cannot patch nested keys.
- `external_tls_cert` and `external_tls_key` must both be set or both null.
- `enable_dicom` requires `dicom_domain_name` to be non-empty.
- `service_account_email` must match `*.gserviceaccount.com`.
